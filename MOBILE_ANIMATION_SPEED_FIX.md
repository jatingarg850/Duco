# Mobile Animation Speed Fix

## Problem
The phone scroller animation (video carousel) on the landing page was too slow on mobile devices, taking 20 seconds to complete one cycle.

## Solution Applied

### Location: `Duco_frontend/src/Pages/Home.jsx`

**Original Animation Speed:**
- Desktop and Mobile: 20 seconds

**New Animation Speeds:**
- Desktop: 20 seconds (unchanged)
- Tablet (≤768px): 8 seconds (2.5x faster)
- Mobile (≤480px): 6 seconds (3.3x faster)

### Code Changes

Added responsive CSS media queries to the existing marquee animation:

```css
/* Original animation */
.animate-marquee {
  display: flex;
  gap: 24px;
  animation: marquee 20s linear infinite;
}

/* Faster animation for mobile devices */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .animate-marquee {
    animation: marquee 8s linear infinite;
  }
}

/* Even faster for very small screens */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .animate-marquee {
    animation: marquee 6s linear infinite;
  }
}
```

## Animation Details

The animation affects the "Floating video carousel" section which displays product review videos in a horizontal scrolling marquee format.

### Breakpoints:
- **Desktop (>768px)**: 20s duration - Maintains original speed for better viewing on larger screens
- **Tablet (≤768px)**: 8s duration - 60% faster for medium screens
- **Mobile (≤480px)**: 6s duration - 70% faster for small screens

## Benefits

1. **Better Mobile UX**: Faster animation keeps mobile users engaged
2. **Responsive Design**: Different speeds optimized for different screen sizes
3. **Maintained Desktop Experience**: Desktop users still get the original, more relaxed pace
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Linear animation ensures consistent speed across all breakpoints

## Testing

To verify the changes:
1. Open the landing page on desktop - should see 20s animation
2. Resize browser to tablet width (≤768px) - should see 8s animation
3. Resize to mobile width (≤480px) - should see 6s animation
4. Test on actual mobile devices for real-world performance

The animation will now provide a much more engaging experience on mobile devices while maintaining the original desktop experience.
